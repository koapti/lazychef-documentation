== Docker
=== Main information
Docker is a useful tool to dockerize an application. You can build your own image of a system, then put there application files and run it. That all does not depend on the system (e.g. Linux, MAC or Windows) on which you run it.

=== How to Run it
==== Backend
There is a `Dockerfile` inside main catalog of the application. You have to run a few commands to build the image and run container with application.

* To build the image (`<version>` is the version of the application):
    ** `docker build -t backend:<version> .`
* To run the container:
    ** `docker run -p 8080:8080 -t backend:<version>`

    -p 8080:8080 means port mapping
